# CLua changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-12

The first release of **CLua**, an ahead-of-time compiler for the Lua 5.4
language targeting Windows x64, and **rover**, its package manager.

### The toolchain

- **`clua.exe`** — `clua build app.lua` → `app.exe` (`-O1` default),
  `clua run app.lua -- args`, `clua check`, `clua version`. Relocatable:
  finds its runtime libraries next to the executable or via `CLUA_HOME`;
  works from any directory. Intermediates go to `%TEMP%` and are cleaned.
- **`rover.exe`** — `init` / `add` / `install` / `update` / `remove` /
  `publish` / `verify` / `list` / `search`, with `rover.toml`/`rover.lock`
  project files, lockfile-reproducible installs, whole-tree Merkle
  integrity, semver ranges, and HMAC-signed remote registries. rover is
  itself a CLua-compiled closed-world program.
- The loop works end to end: `rover install <pkg>` → `require "<pkg>"` →
  `clua build` bundles the installed package into the exe.

### The compiled output

- Ordinary PE: native x64 code, standard sections — no bytecode blob, no
  in-binary VM, no JIT. A hello-world is ~177 KB, fully static.
- Emitted exes link a dedicated AOT runtime: no JIT compiler, no Lua
  front-end (`load`-family symbols are closed-world stubs), no FFI, no
  winpthread, and — for programs that never mention `debug` — no bytecode
  interpreter. Programs that use the debug library keep the interpreter and
  match the reference interpreter under `debug.sethook` exactly.
- The optimizer (`-O1`): static int/float type inference with tag-check
  elision, bare integer FORLOOP, loop-region register residency (R12–R15/RSI
  + xmm6–xmm10), interprocedural type propagation. Tight integer loops run
  ~17× the faithful boxed baseline. Soundness was adversarially validated
  across 13 attack rounds; the differential oracle (every program's output
  byte-compared against the reference interpreter at -O0 and -O1) is the
  arbiter, enforced by a 466-test suite.

### Closed world (by design)

`load`, `loadstring`, `dofile`, `string.dump`, and dynamic `require` are
compile errors. Code that evades the static scan gets an attributed runtime
error instead of an escape hatch (see `docs/known-bugs-2026-06-07.md` for
the three documented bounded divergences).

### Requirements & limitations

- Windows x64 only. A MinGW-w64 gcc on PATH (or `CLUA_GCC`) performs the
  final native link — the one external step (a self-contained PE writer is
  planned).
- The ~195 in-tree builtin packages (`json`, `hash`, …) do not yet bundle
  into compiled exes — requiring one is a loud compile error
  (rover-installed packages work). Planned (M4) alongside FFI-in-exes.
- Uncaught runtime errors print `clua: runtime error: <msg>` without a
  stack traceback (AOT-ERRBANNER-001); the message itself matches the
  reference interpreter.
